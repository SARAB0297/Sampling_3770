Sampling Techniques Repository


This repository focuses on sampling techniques and their application in data analysis, machine learning, and statistics.
The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of sampling types and tasks, ensuring a foundation for accurate and reliable data interpretation.

📋 Sampling Types Covered
1. Random Sampling
Every individual or observation has an equal probability of being selected.
Tasks:
Selecting subsets from datasets.
Ensuring unbiased representation.
2. Stratified Sampling
Divides the population into subgroups (strata) and samples from each.
Tasks:
Ensuring proportional representation.
Handling imbalanced datasets.
3. Systematic Sampling
Selects samples at regular intervals from an ordered list.
Tasks:
Simplifying large dataset sampling.
Maintaining ordered patterns.
4. Cluster Sampling
Groups the population into clusters and samples entire clusters.
Tasks:
Reducing sampling costs.
Managing geographically dispersed populations.

🛠️ Tasks and Implementation
Implemented sampling functions using Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas.

Visualized results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Evaluated the impact of sampling techniques on model performance.

Discussed trade-offs and limitations of each technique.
